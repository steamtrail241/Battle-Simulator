# Battle-Simulator
Ready up commander! The enemy is on our footsteps!
From the rolling hills too the boggy swamps, rout the enemy and make them pay!
Amongst the shattering sounds of barrage, amidst the stalwart formations of musketmen, or atop a mount charging with the cuirassiers, take command, and see it to the end.

Good luck commander, and may god be on our side.
